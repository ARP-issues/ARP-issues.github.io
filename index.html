	<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
		<p class="textcontent">Android introduces a new permission model that allows apps to request permissions at runtime rather than at the installation
            time since 6.0 (Marshmallow, API level 23). While this runtime permission model provides users with greater flexibility in controlling an
            app’s access to sensitive data and system features, it brings new challenges to app development. First, as users may grant or revoke
            permissions at any time while they are using an app, developers need to ensure that the app properly checks and requests required
            permissions before invoking any permission-protected APIs. Second, Android’s permission mechanism keeps evolving and getting
            customized by device manufacturers. Developers are expected to comprehensively test their apps on different Android versions and
            device models to make sure permissions are properly requested in all situations. Unfortunately, these requirements are often
            impractical for developers. In practice, many Android apps suffer from various runtime permission issues (ARP issues).

            While existing studies have explored ARP issues, the understanding of such issues is still preliminary. To better characterize ARP
            issues, we performed an empirical study using 135 Stack Overflow posts that discuss ARP issues and 199 real ARP issues archived in
            popular open-source Android projects on GitHub. Via analyzing the data, we observed 11 types of ARP issues that commonly occur in
            Android apps. For each type of issues, we systematically studied: (1) how they can be manifested, (2) how pervasive and serious they
            are in real-world apps, and (3) how they can be fixed. We also analyzed the evolution trend of different types of issues from 2015 to
            2020 to understand their impact on the Android ecosystem. Furthermore, we conducted a field survey and in-depth interviews among
            practitioners, to gain insights from industrial practices and learn practitioners’ requirements of tools that can help combat ARP issues.
            Finally, to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the existing ARP issue detectors, we built ARPBENCH, an open benchmark
            consisting of 94 real ARP issues, and evaluated the performance of three available ARP issue detectors. The experimental results
            indicate that the existing tools have very limited supports for detecting our observed issue types and report a large number of false
            alarms. We further analyzed the tools’ limitations and summarized the challenges of designing an effective ARP issue detection
            technique. We hope that our findings can shed light on future research and provide useful guidance to practitioners.		</p>
