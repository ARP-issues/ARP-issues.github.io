	<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
		<p class="textcontent">Android 6.0 introduces a new permission mechanism that allows apps to request permissions at runtime rather than installation time. 
		While this runtime permission mechanism offers users greater flexibility in controlling an app's access to sensitive data and system features, 
		it brings new challenges to app development. 
		First, as users may grant or revoke a permission at any time, developers need to ensure that their app checks for and properly requests required 
		permissions before performing any critical actions. 
		Second, since its introduction, the runtime permission mechanism keeps evolving and often gets customized by Android device manufacturers. 
		Developers are expected to carefully test their apps on different Android versions or device models to check if permissions are properly requested
		in all situations. 
		Unfortunately, these requirements are impractical to real-world developers. 
		Many Android apps in fact suffer from various runtime permission issues (ARP issues).
		</p>
		<p class="textcontent2em">
		While existing studies have explored ARP issues, the understanding of such issues is still very limited. 
		In this work, we performed a large-scale empirical study of ARP issues, aiming to gain a deeper understanding of the issues and build a taxonomy. 
		Specifically, we analyzed 135 high-quality posts on Stack Overflow and 157 real ARP issues on GitHub. 
		Based on the analysis, we found 11 patterns of ARP issues. 
		For each pattern, we studied: 
		(1) how the issues can be manifested, (2) how pervasive and serious they are in real-world apps, and (3) how they can be fixed. 
		We also studied the evolution trends of different issue patterns from 2015 to 2019 and the potential impacts of different ARP issues on the 
		Android ecosystem. Based on our findings, we further discussed the challenges in designing effective techniques to detect ARP issues. 
		We hope that our study can shed light on future research and are of practical value to Android practitioners.
